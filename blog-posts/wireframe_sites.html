					For the homepage, goodreads is attempting to solve the problem of reading being a solitary activity.  By giving reviews your friends have written prime real estate, you are given a chance to interact and discuss.  It would be nice to give suggested reading a larger section rather than the relatively small space it occupies, as it does a good job analyzing your favorite books and finding similar ones you might not have heard about.  The ad space is respectful and non-obtrusive and mainly features books, so it doesn't feel out of place.

				<p>
					The homepage of FantasyFootballMetrics' main objective is to try to sell the viewer their brand.  Most of the homepage is dedicated to their draft guide on the left row and how it differs from that of other draft guides.  To be fair, it is one of the few ways this site creates its revenue, since it does not feature third-party ads, but it is still a bit abrasive.  One of their greatest resources, the weekly projections, is only given a single link in the header; it would make more sense to allocate at least some space on the body to make it easier to find projections of specific positions or players.  On the right row it features the site's recent top articles.				</p>

				<p>
					Crunchyroll's homepage's primary objective is to be a one-stop shop.  It does a good job of balancing ad space, suggested media, forum discussion, and the latest news.  Its sliding image box is given the prominent top position on the left side of the page, while daily deals are placed beside it on the right.  Below both is more text-based content, with anime news and forum discussion links shown next.
