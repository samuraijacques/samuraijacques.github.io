					The DBC experience to me is that of passion and collaboration.  Shereef made it very clear that in order to succeed in DBC, you have to work together and you have to want to be there.  This kind of commitment required is pretty intimidating, but I feel like I'm up for the challenge.  I get the general sense that the people who work for DBC are there because they truly believe in DBC's formula and are willing to go all out to make that happen.  The least I can do is reciprocate those intentions.

					I'll admit that my mindset was exactly like the consumer mindset that Shereef was talking about.  I expected to put in x amount of hours and money to get y results.  But now that I'm aware of the fact that there is an alternate way of thinking I can make that change for the better.  Immersion has always been the best teacher for me, and this program is exactly that times ten.  I just hope I can keep up with everyone, as I'm definitely one of those people who feel like they are outclassed by everyone else.  That just means I have to try even harder and not be afraid to ask for help.
