			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					Going into college, I didn't have a specific career path in mind, so my reasoning was that I should major in something that really interests me.  I chose to be a pyschology/philosophy major because I've always been fascinated by people and how they think, why they think how they think, etc.  So it comes with little surprise that my Gregorc thinking style falls under the abstract random category, the most “people” oriented of the four.  Looking down the list provided in our reading materials, the only bullet points I don't associate myself with is disliking competition and not being able to concentrate at one thing at a time.  While I definitely have a couple qualities from abstract sequential, which is apparently my secondary thinking style, I think I can say with a  good degree of certainty that I am in the abstract random wagon.  That being said, what does that mean in context to my experiences with DBC?  
				</p>
				<p>
					The fact that DBC is highly collaborative and social plays to my strengths perfectly.  Whenever a group project comes up, I invariably become the mediator of the group by helping others bring their issues and ideas to the forefront.  And as far as I can tell, a lot of the way DBC is formatted promotes this kind of interaction with their flipped classroom model.  My expectations for when phase 1 starts are very high as far as how much I'm going to be able to learn.  
				</p>
				<p>
					So far in phase 0 the toughest part has definitely been having to work by myself as well as being by myself.  My favorite part of being a psychology/philosophy major was that I was able to bounce off ideas and voice my difficulties with my professors and fellow students during lecture and discussion.  I am also one of those weirdos who actually liked discussion sections.  With phase 0 being a primarily solitary venture, I find myself constantly at a loss at how to move forward.
				</p>
				<p>
					The most obvious way to make my thinking style more well-rounded is to work on the aspects that are considered to be difficult for someone categorized as abstract random.  The most prominent one that stand out to me are having to explain or justify my feelings and accepting all forms of criticism.  Whenever I'm working on anything, I never really have an “inner voice” that follows any sort of real logic; a lot of how I solve problems is by intuition.  While that might have worked well in college where most of my work was my own, I will need to be able to express my thought process and reasoning behind what I code in order to collaborate effectively.
