				<p>
					It's a dangerous thing to ask to compare and contrast one thing to another on the internet.  Often times less level-headed readers will go on holy crusades defending their camp while sniping ad hominem jabs at their counterparts.  This invariably leads to death threats, baseless attacks on my sexuality, as well as a surprising number of people who claim to have had carnal knowledge with my mother.
					<br>
					Fortunately nobody's gonna read this besides like, two of you guys, so I probably don't have to worry about any of that.
					<br>
					Rather than thinking of the relationship between these two languages as "Ruby vs Javascript,"" it's better to think of it as "Ruby or Javascript.""  When comparing the two, there is no clear winner, as each has their own unique strengths and flaws.  The only question to ask is in what situation would I use one over the other?
				</p>
				<p>
					First off: Javascript.  Javascript's main strengths have been highlighted in the previous week's technical blog, but to summarize, it is a powerful scripting language that is accessible from all browser platforms.  It is fast, lightweight, and fairly easy to understand and learn.  Javascript is executed on the client side, which means that it is extremely fast and responsive.  However, two main issues continue to plague Javascript: lack of security and the fact that it will oftentimes render differently on different browsers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Javascript sounds pretty awesome, but how about Ruby?  Ruby, like Javascript, is an object-oriented language, but when you compare the two side-by-side, many would say that Ruby is easier to understand and learn, mainly due to how it was built with human languages in mind.  It is also a much more succinct and concise language compared to the syntax of Javascript.  Ruby on Rails allows web developers to quickly .  Ruby's main detraction is that it has a heavier loadout compared to Javascript and will therefore run slower and will tax your system more.
				</p>
				<p>
					So when should you use Ruby or Javascript?  There are a few different factors to take into account.  If you need something created quickly and efficiently, Ruby should definitely be your first choice.  However, if you need a website that requires a high level of features and functionality, you'd be better of with Javascript.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the whole, it's not too difficult to switch between Javascript and Ruby, as both have a lot of similarities.  However, there are a lot of little differences that one must be made aware of when distinguishing between the two.  For example, when incrementing in Javascript, one would write out ++; in Ruby it would be +=.  A function in Javascript serves the same purpose as a method in Ruby.  The syntax of writing out an array is slightly different in both.  Little things that add up to big differences.
