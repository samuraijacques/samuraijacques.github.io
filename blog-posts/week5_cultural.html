			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					My first experiences with peer pairing was reminiscent of my very first date in middle school.  Lots of awkward silences, bad jokes, and  failed attempts at getting a kiss in the movie theater.  Fortunately, just as I learned that girls don't appreciate the nuances of a your mom joke, I learned how to effectively pair with others to the point where I don't feel like a detriment.  Working with someone else makes completing my weekly challenges so much easier, as I am the type of person who thrives when I have at least one other person to bounce ideas off of.  I also really appreciate the fact that I have the opportunity to get to know my cohort-mates beforehand; I’ve already made strong connections with others which will help us all once phase 1 starts. 
				</p>
				<p>
					One thing i've really come to appreciate is the quality of people DBC has managed to round up.  I have yet to meet someone who is not extremely smart, understanding, and motivated to learn.  Every person i've paired with has given me invaluable advice on how to improve my coding as well as my mindset on learning in general.  
				</p>
				<p>
					I honestly feel extremely humbled whenever I read the feedback that is given to me.  In my opinion the vast majority of the people I’ve worked with seemed so much smarter and more experienced; the fact that many of them were saying how I was extremely helpful during our sessions has greatly boosted my self-esteem.  I'll be perfectly honest, after the nightmare that was the first week of phase 0 I was seriously questioning whether or not I belonged in DBC.  But as I read more and more positive and encouraging feedback from others I began to think that maybe I actually do belong.
