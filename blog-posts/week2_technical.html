				<p>
					When you're building a website, you're always going to have to worry about margins, borders, and padding.  Any element you have in your page generates a box which contains these attributes.  These element boxes will, by default, only provide a small amount of space around them, but you can change the sizes of all three of these in order for your content to fit on the page better.  Think of the element box as an onion: the outermost layer consists of the margin, followed by the border and padding.  In the sweet, juicy center of it all is your element content.
				</p>
				<p>
					Margins are applied to the outside of the element box, which therefore will effect the spacing your element has from other elements.
				</p>
				<p>
					The border is exactly that: a border.  It's the line that separates the margin from the padding, simple as that.
				</p>
				<p>
					Padding is very similar to margins except for the fact that padding works with the space between the content area and its borders.  Because it is applied to the inside of the element box, it will effect how far the element's contents are from the border.  A good illustration of the difference between these two is when you have a background image in your box; the image will extend into the padding, but it won't in the margin.
