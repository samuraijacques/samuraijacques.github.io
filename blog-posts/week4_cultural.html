					One of the many selling points any given tech startup will give a prospective employee is that "there's no red tape, so there's nothing to slow down what needs to be done!"" or "you'll never have to worry about being politically correct, we're like a family here!"  While that does sound appealing at first glance, the question is whether or not this type of work environment is conducive to a productive, successful workplace.  According to most of the research, the answer to that is a resounding NO.

				<p>
					The sad fact of the matter is that whatever human resource management that present in most of these startups are only there to present carrots for the proverbial rabbit to chase after in the form of  rather than provide structure to the employees.  Instead of giving a channel for a disgruntled employee a legitimate resource to express their frustrations, they give out free beer and pool tables and leave it to the workers to resolve issues.  Because the onus of creating the work culture is on employees, this means that everyone is subject to the prejudices of whoever is most influential.  
				</p>
				<p>
					This lack of real support leads invariably to a volatile work environment, as evidenced by a <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/ces/research/specproject.html"> Stanford longitudinal study</a>, which leads to an increase in a startup's failure rate.  On the flip side, startups with a strong organizational foundation were 40% more likely to go public.  I'm not saying that a startup's level of bureaucracy should be at the level of, say, the US government's, but there is definitely a sweet spot that every startup can very easily achieve.
