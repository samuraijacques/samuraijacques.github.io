					It's depressing to think that in our modern day and age something so backwards as racism not only exists, but is also extremely pervasive and deeply rooted in our culture.  Even though we have made great strides in America when we compare how things were 50 years ago, it is nowhere near where we should be if we want to call ourselves a civilized society.

					Racism today does not manifest the way it did 50 years ago.  Instead of having segregated school and making interracial marriage illegal, more insidious forms of racism, like stereotypes, have become the norm.  Although I am not considered a targeted minority, I have definitely experienced stereotype threat in almost every aspect of my life.  Growing up in an all white community as the resident Asian, I was the punching bag of almost every stereotype there was.  I was constantly being told that I wouldn't be good at sports, that I was a nerd, that I was a terrible driver, that I didn't know how to talk to a girl.  I understand that most of these insults were made in jest, but that doesn't make what people were saying to me any less hurtful, and it didn't make what they were saying any less impactful towards the way I responded.  Dr. Steele's observations of how a person with an isolated identity feels the weight of that identity more and fears reinforcing it really hit home.  I'd purposefully not do as well in school to stop people from saying that being Asian was the reason behind my performance (not the greatest strategy, I know, but cut me some slack, I was 14).  I refused to get a drivers license until I was 19 so I wouldn't have to hear the ever so original “lol you can't drive because you're Asian” joke every time I left the parking lot.  I was forced to date outside of my school because I didn't have the confidence to talk to my female classmates.  It got to the point where I started believing that what everyone was saying was true.  I know now that kids are assholes and will say hurtful things without thinking about the consequences, but it took me a very long time to come to that conclusion.
				</p>

					The main reason why this constant badgering happened to me was because I simply never tried to stop people from doing so.  I thought that by just laughing it off people would get tired of saying the same fucking thing all the time, but all that did was reinforce in their minds that I was ok with what they were saying, and so the jokes continued.  I told my best friend a few years ago how I hated all the jokes that everyone made, and he was genuinely surprised because of the way I traditionally responded.  But after that talk he never made another Asian joke again.  All those years of torment, and I could've stopped it with just a five minute talk.  If more people in similar situations came to realize that suffering silently will only cause more suffering and that something as simple as communicating with others could help solve those problems, we would all be better off.
