				<p>
					It's strange to think that a language that took only ten days to create would have such a great effect on the world of technology today, but Javascript somehow managed to do just that.  Created in 1995 as a lightweight interpreted language to work alongside java, it has since grown to become the standard scripting language of all browsers.  Today you will find javascript in virtually every single website you will visit in any given day.  There are many reasons why javascript is so popular; it's very fast, it's very lightweight, it's versatile (can be inserted into any web page regardless of the file extension), and there are libraries of documentation as well as a huge open source community to work with, making it relatively easy to learn.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, nothing comes without downside.  The main con about javascript is that it is a purely front-end language.  This means that it is dependent on other technologies to fetch server data (however this is being remedied by Node.js).  It is also not very well secured.  Because it's a front-end system, it runs on the users' computer, which gives opportunities for malicious code to infect that computer.  Lastly, javascript can have rendering problems on different browsers due to their innate differences.   Although this is a fading issue that is being fixed in the latest versions of javascript, it is still prevalent today.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite these limitations, Javascript is more popular than ever, and that is because its pros vastly outweigh its cons.  Until something much better comes along, we can expect a lot more Java in the foreseeable future.
