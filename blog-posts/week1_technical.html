					Books have always been a huge part of my life.  As a child growing up without television, my options for entertaining myself were fairly limited; sure, I could've gone into the great outdoors to explore and play, but that would've required me to...you know...go outside.  So I turned to books.  Through books I experienced the best and worst  man has to offer and, as a result, shaped me into the man I am today.  Long story short reading is an important part of my life and it continues to affect how I live that life.  
					<br>
					It seems only natural for one of my favorite websites to revolve around books.  Goodreads is a website that brings the reading community together and gives them a platform to share their thoughts and give and find recommendations.  It also has regular AMA's with famous authors, which allows us fans to connect with those we admire on a personal level. 
					<br>
					Looking at the site itself reminds oneself of a bookshelf.  It's color palette has an earthy, woodlike theme and its posts are sorted very much how one would sort books.  If you are signed it, most of what you see are your friends' recent reviews.  This is the whole idea behind goodreads: have a large community with a diverse background that can lead you to find something you were not expecting.  It is fairly easy to browse through the site as it has a very robust search engine that allows you to search by title, author name, or ISBN.  While on this site I'm always put into a good mood; its design evokes waves of nostalgia that carry into the experience itself.  Going through each page of recommended books makes me feel like i'm nine years old again, sitting in my special corner of the bookstore while following the adventures of Martin the Warrior or Ender Wiggin.

					I remember the first football game I ever watched in vivid detail.  It was superbowl XXXI, the underdog patriots versus the powerhouse packers.  I was wearing some god-awful couch-print jacket which, sadly, was the nicest article of clothing I owned.  My cousin, who wanted the packers to win, insisted on sitting on me the entire game due to the fact that I bore a striking resemblance to my uncle's ottoman while wearing said jacket.  Being half his age and half his weight, I couldn't really do much other than root for the patriots, so root for the patriots I did.  They ended up losing, but on that night the first seeds of my fandom was sown.
					<br>
					If you're a sports fan of any kind it is almost impossible to resist the allure of fantasy sports.  Every one of us thinks we know the game better than everyone else, and fantasy is the perfect way to show that.  The more you get into fantasy, the more you get caught up in a sort of arms race to find the best sources of information and insight to get that one edge that will help you win your league.  Today, against my better judgment, I'll reveal my personal secret weapon: fantasy football metrics.
					<br>
					What I like most about fantasy football metrics is its simplicity and straightforwardness.  Rather than eyeballing a prospect and arguing whether or not a quarterback's arm is strong enough or if a runningback is elusive enough, fantasy football metrics does exactly what its name entails: it uses statistical analysis of each player's performance as well as his physical attributes, puts it through an algorithm, and gives a projection of that player's performance in the weeks to come.
					<br>
					Its philosophy in practice also carries over to how its site is designed.  Looking at it, one would not be wrong in calling it “bare-bones.”  It uses a simple navy blue and white template that gives off the vibe of being straightforward and businesslike.  It doesn't try to distract you with pictures or news that is not germane to player performance.  However, it does suffer from wall-of-text syndrome since that is literally all the content the site has to offer.
					<br>
					While the main author of the website like to inject humor and pop culture references in his posts, the bulk of his content is geared towards letting us viewers know who or what is trending statistically.  Because of this, being on the site for a while gives me a sense of clinical detachment.  The players who I am a fan of are no longer players, they are numbers.  They are a means to an end, and that end is victory.

					Anime has always been something of a guilty pleasure of mine.  The first anime I watched regularly, like many boys my age, was Dragonball Z.  Watching it today makes me wonder how I had the patience (does Goku <em>really</em> need ten episodes to make one goddamn spirit bomb?), but back then our choices were limited.  My perception of the world of anime extended to DBZ, Transformers, and Pokemon, and for the longest time I never thought that it would have more to offer.  That is until the day I started watching Fullmetal Alchemist.  Realizing for the first time that the audience for anime wasn't limited to only children, that there were shows out there with substance, depth, and character development, was a seminal moment in my childhood.  I would wager that watching shows like Mushi-shi, Baccano!, and Steins;Gate shaped me just as much as any book I have ever read.
					<br>
					Fast-forward to the present day.  The world wide web has made watching whatever anime you wish with the click of a button.  There are many different sites where you could do so.  Hulu has a robust collection that continues to grow every day; Netflix is planning on producing a netflix anime original to supplement their already vast collection.  However, my favorite place for all things anime is Crunchyroll.  The main problem I have with Hulu and Netflix anime, respectively, are the highly distractive and over-the-top ads and the terrible lack of subbed anime.  Crunchyroll seeks to solve both problems.  While its collection of available streams is definitely smaller, it focuses on quality stream content with minimal advertizing.  Because it supplements its revenue with all sorts of japanese paraphernalia as well as a subscription service that gets rid of ads all together, what little ads I do have to watch very rarely are longer than 30 seconds.  
					<br>
					Getting down to the brass tacks of the website, when one sees the homepage of Crunchyroll its purpose is abundantly clear.  Its bright color palette of white, orange, and yellow is reminiscent of that of a typical anime vignette.  When you first set your eyes on this site, the very first thing you notice is the scrolling image box of the most popular anime that is currently available for stream.  For both the veteran and the uninitiated, this is a great tool to get either get started or catch up to the latest show.  Also on the page are links to the most recent anime news, forum links to discuss the previous night's episode, and a daily deal from their store.  Put simply, it has everything an anime lover would ever want.  Although the search engine could use a little work and the amount of clutter as you get to the bottom of the page is a little excessive, the site as a whole is very well put together.  
					<br>
					The main emotion I feel when I'm on this site is probably excitement.  The amount of resources available to me is almost overwhelming, but I manage to keep my composure and take advantage of everything this site has to offer.
