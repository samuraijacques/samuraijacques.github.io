				<h2><b>What is Keto?</b></h2>
				<p>
					The ketogenic diet, or keto for short, is a high fat, moderate protein, and very low carb diet that was originally created to help children with epilepsy reduce the frequency of their seizures.  How high is high fat?  About 65-70% of your daily caloric intake should be coming from mono and saturated fats, such as olive oil, butter, and animal fat.  How low is low carb?  Ideally you want to be taking in between 20-50 grams of carbohydrates a day, with most of these coming from vegetables and nuts.  To get an idea of how little carbs 50 grams is, a single bagel contains almost 50 grams of carbs.  Over time people began to realize that this diet could also be used for rapid weight loss.  Further studies suggested that this dietary composition has many more health benefits than the traditional western high carb diet.  Many people (msyelf included) choose this lifestyle because of these benefits (as well as the awesome side benefit of eating as much bacon as you want while losing weight.)  If you'd like to know more about the many benefits keto can provide, I highly suggest taking a look at the links provided in the sidebar.

				<h2>Wait a Second, High Fat?  How Can You Lose Fat By Eating Fat???</h2>
				<ul>

						At first glance this does seem very counterintuitive.  Much of what we have been taught, whether it be from school, at home, or from the media, has told us to stay away from fats like it is the devil.  And taking a cursory look at the evidence would support that assertion.  It is true to a certain extent that eating high fat foods can be harmful to you, but <b>only</b> if you combine that with a high amount of carbs.  You've heard stories of people with clogged arteries and everyone assumes that the cause of this is fats clogging them up.  But what recent studies have suggested is that the inflammatory properties of carbohydrates constrict those arteries, making clogging a much more likely possibility.

						When your body is presented with both fats and carbohydrates, it will always choose to metabolize whatever is quicker and easier.  In this case your body will choose the carbs before fats.  Because the energy that fat can provide is not needed, your body will immediately store that fat because it is easy to store.  What keto does is force your body to use both fats in your body as well as the fats you are eating for energy since it's first choice of carbs isn't available.
